#Docker Android AVD with WhatsApp pre-installed
A Docker image based on Ubuntu Desktop with VNC and noVNC access, that runs a lightweight Android Virtual Device.

The Dockerfile uses the following image as a base: [dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc:xenial](https://hub.docker.com/r/dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc/)

## Deployment

`docker-compose up --build`

## VNC Access

Server: `localhost:5900`

## Web Access (noVNC)

Visit `localhost:6080/vnc.html`

TODO: Put Credentials
* Default username: `root`
* Default password: `secret`


## Start Android AVD

Using Supervisord to manage the services, the Android AVD should start up automatically with WhatsApp pre-installed.

`DISPLAY=:0 ${ANDROID_HOME}/tools/emulator @WappAPP -gpu off`
Using `emulator` throws an error described somewhere on SO... can't recall where, anyway the fix is to call from directory directly.

## Further Development

I'd like to stream a VNC feed via the `v4l2loopback` kernel module into the Android AVD... WIP. This would allow one to scan WhatsApp web barcodes remotely.
